* WHY
There is a Pro Platinum map for the Z33. 
I am copying as much of that as possible and converting it
for the haltech elite 2500.
It's sad there is no proper base map for the Z33 in the NSP software
so I'm trying to make one.

This is a base map that should work similar 
as the stock ECU, but, based on VE. 

Since the 03 and early 04 did not have a wideband, 
I wanted a self correcting ECU based on accurate wideband data.

* SETUP
1. Haltech WB2 kit installed in the bungs closest to the headers.
2. Boomslang Z33 PnP harness
3. Haltech elite 2500

* ISSUES - 20250731
1. After fixing the fuel pressure input type, the AFR's are where they
need to be. But now the problem is, it feels like the VVT doesn't kick on? The car feels great and hits proper AFR's up till 3k, Then
it feels like it loses power.
2. slip light on
3. VDC switch doesn't work.
