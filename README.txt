* WHY
There is a Pro Platinum map for the Z33. 
I am copying as much of that as possible and converting it
for the haltech elite 2500.
It's sad there is no proper base map for the Z33 in the NSP software
so I'm trying to make one.

This is a base map that should work similar 
as the stock ECU, but, based on VE. 

Since the 03 and early 04 did not have a wideband, 
I wanted a self correcting ECU based on accurate wideband data.

* SETUP
1. Haltech WB2 kit installed in the bungs closest to the headers.
2. Boomslang Z33 PnP harness
3. Haltech elite 2500

* ISSUES
1. Car runs rich. will idle around 13.8-14.2
2. slip light on
3. VDC switch doesn't work.
