1. I made mistake of changing under fuel tuning ->  Fuel Pressure Input Type to a MAP option. Supposed to be Constant. 
2. The Pro Platinum map calls for 46.4 psi base fuel pressure.

1. More clean up of intake cams. % duty cycles.
2. Added transmission gear ratios. Can't believe it took me this long to see that.
3. Set the RPM limit which again, this is supposed to be a base map, is 6500 rpm. 
4. Copying from the Plat Pro Z33 VE map, cleaned up the timing table.

1. removal of uneeded items like 750rpm/1200rpm lines.
2. removal of columns above +2.9 atmospheric since this is a NA map.
3. Remove lines with rpms above 8k rpms since this for basic NA VQ35DE which
probably won't see anything over 7200 rpms even after being built. 
4. Made sure the best options for correcting the map are available. MAP for fuel,
timing corrections can be done after knock is detected and can be applied to the map.
